# Sowing-Success

## Overview
This project aims to optimize crop selection for farmers using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data on crop soil characteristics, the system assists farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate in a particular area.

Features
Data Collection: Gather historical data on crop yields, soil quality.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

Model Training: Develop machine learning models to predict crop yields based on input features such as soil type, climate, and agricultural practices.

Crop Selection: Utilize trained models to recommend the most suitable crops for a given location and set of conditions.
